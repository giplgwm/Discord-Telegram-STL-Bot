# Discord-Telegram-STL Bot

Usage: Import your api keys into the config section at the top of main.py

# Not sure if this still works after python 3.10 due to asyncio changes. No longer using this bot anyway so i don't maintain it, feel free to update and use it yourself or download and run it on python 3.10 or lower
